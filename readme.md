## Implements guarenteed delivery on top of UDP using stop and wait. 

To run create a text file and enter the name into senderDriver, currently "important.txt" then set the file name in recDriver to something that it will save as. make sure the port number in recDriver and the second port number (line 10) in sender driver are the same.

This program will send many file types, not just text. 

Wrote for a networks class at university.
